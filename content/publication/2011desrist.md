Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In recent decades, ‚Äúagile‚Äù software development methodologies have been put forth as an alternative to traditional ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù methodologies. These agile methods advance a fundamentally different approach to software development. Empirical evidence indicates differences between the two with respect to outcomes and development experience. Yet little is known to what extent the actual development practices based on either agile or traditional life cycle methodologies differ. In the current study we examine the variation in performative routines during software development by contrasting agile and traditional lifecycle process models using event sequencing method for detecting activity variations among recorded performative processes in the selected projects. Our analysis shows that performative enactment of waterfall and agile ostensive routines do differ in terms of activity types carried out in the early requirements steps. However, performative routines did show conformance to ostensive specifications in iterations, affordance types, and design objects used."
