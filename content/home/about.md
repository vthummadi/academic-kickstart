# Biography

Dr. B Veeresh Thummadi is a Research Fellow at Lero, The Irish Software Research Centre, located in Limerick, Ireland. His research focuses on the software development. In his recent research projects, he has focussed on studying how agile and waterfall methods differ in practise, and how open source projects attract voluntary workforce, and how geographical clustering affects the survival of open source projects. 

Much of this research uses fine-grained qualitative and quantitative data to tease out how software development work practises emerge and differ due to developers' habits, motivations and project conditions. His published papers have analyzed the differences in agile and waterfall practises, and agile innovative work practises.
